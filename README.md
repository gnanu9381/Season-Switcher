# Season Switcher

Season Switcher is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to switch between images representing the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. With a click of a button, the displayed images change to match your selected season, offering a visual representation suitable for learning, fun, or demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Responsive seasonal images for both mobile and desktop devices.
- Four easy-to-use buttons to switch between Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
- Smooth image transitions with no page reload.
- Stylish and minimal design using Bootstrap for layout and custom CSS for themed buttons.
